Database Management System (DBMS):
To enhance the management of the backend database used in this web application, we are developing a web-based Database Management System (DBMS). This system will provide an intuitive interface for administrators to perform various database management tasks, including:

Viewing and managing collections
Adding, updating, and deleting documents
Querying and analyzing data
User authentication and access control

Technologies Used:
Frontend Framework: React.js
Backend Framework: Express.js
Database: MongoDB
Backend Database Integration: Mongoose
User Authentication: Passport.js
Frontend UI Library: Bootstrap or Material-UI
API Communication: Axios
Security: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication and authorization
Other Tools: CORS for cross-origin resource sharing, bcrypt.js for password hashing
